# Blog App

My Blog is a vanilla JavaScript app which enables the user to write articles. It is built in HTML, with vanilla CSS and JavaScript. App is structured in MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture model, which splits the application into three parts for easier understanding and less spaghetti code.

You can check out the [live demo](https://danijelmaksic.github.io/My-Blog-App/).
